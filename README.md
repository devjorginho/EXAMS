# Advanced C Exercises Solutions

Welcome to my collection of **advanced C programming exercises** solutions! This repository contains over **50 carefully crafted solutions** to challenging problems, designed to improve problem-solving skills and deepen understanding of C language concepts.

## üöÄ About This Repository

This repo showcases my journey mastering **advanced C programming** through practical problem-solving. The exercises cover a wide range of topics including:

- Pointer manipulation and memory management  
- Data structures (linked lists, trees, stacks, queues)  
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion)  
- Bitwise operations and low-level programming  
- String manipulation and parsing  
- File handling and system calls  
- Optimization and performance considerations  

Each solution is implemented with a focus on clean, efficient, and idiomatic C code.

## üéØ Why This Matters

Practicing advanced C exercises helps in:  
- Developing a deeper grasp of memory and pointer concepts  
- Improving debugging and analytical thinking skills  
- Preparing for technical interviews or coding assessments  
- Laying a solid foundation for systems programming, embedded development, and more  

## üìÇ Organization

Exercises are organized by difficulty levels for a progressive learning experience:

- **Level01**  
- **Level02**  
- **Level03**  
- **Level04**  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To compile and run a solution, simply:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o program path/to/exercise.c
./program

```

Replace path/to/exercise.c with the desired source file.
